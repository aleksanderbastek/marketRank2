## Requirements:
Java SE Development Kit 17

## Setup and Sturtup Project
To run this project you must type this command into terminal in project folder
- .\gradle build
- .\gradlew run  
If you have installed gradle
- gradle build
- gradle run

## Code editor
I'm using InteliJ IDEA thus the best way to build the app is open it in InteliJ IDEA. But using this IDE to run the project is not essential you are free to use an environment that you prefer.

## How the program works
After you enter build and run commands into the terminal you will see the "Wait for fetching data" message. Fetching data from API could take even 2 minutes. Then script writes a txt file with a result. If the txt file won't appear in the file explorer of your IDE, click on the file explorer window to refresh it.
